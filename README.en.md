# Websocket Server

A simple websocket server developed using Node.js. It can simulate data to facilitate client-side debugging.

## Development Background

In one of the company's sports products, websockets are used to send and receive data. When the client-side developers debug, they need to connect to the device via websocket and perform various actions to debug the data returned by the device.

To quickly verify the data, this simple websocket server was written to simulate the data sent by the hardware product in various scenarios. This way, even without actual device interaction, the entire process can be tested, which can greatly improve the development, debugging, and testing efficiency.

## Usage

1. Configure the Node.js development environment;
2. Execute the following command in the project root directory:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Customize the test message
   In the ***index.js*** file, modify the following code:
   ```
   ws.on("message", (message, isBinary) => {
     // Customize the message here
   })
   ```
4. Execute the following command in the project root directory:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
5. The client connects to the websocket `ws://127.0.0.1:8080` and sends the customized message to the server, and processes the server's response data.
